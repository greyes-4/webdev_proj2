      <h1>Volleyball</h1>

      <p>Volleyball is a game played by two teams, with each team having six players. Players use their hands to hit a ball over a high net. A point is scored when the ball touches the court within the opponent's playing area. To prevent being scored on, a player can hit the ball up toward a teammate before the ball touches the ground. The second player can either hit the ball over the net or pass it to a third teammate, who can then hit it across the net. Only three touches are allowed before the ball must be returned over the net.</p>

        <p>An underhand serve is one of the safest and most basic ways to get the ball over the net. First, ensure you're behind the service line, with your non-dominant foot slightly forward. Hold the ball at thigh-height with your non-dominant hand and make a fist with your dominant hand. Bring your dominant arm back, step forward with your dominant foot, and swing your arm to make contact with the ball. Aim to hit the ball at an angle that gives it good height while moving forward.</p>

        <p>For passing, you want to make contact with the ball using the lower part of your arms. Place one hand on top of the other with both palms facing up, then bring your thumbs together at the tips of your fingers. Extend your arms to create a solid platform for passing. To achieve a high pass, use your legs to push through the ball and move to position yourself comfortably before making contact.</p>

        <p>When itâ€™s time to attack, learning how to perform a downball is essential. Ensure you're positioned beneath the ball, with your non-dominant foot slightly ahead. Use your non-dominant hand to aim at the ball, while your dominant hand prepares to strike by bringing your elbow back, as if drawing a bow. As the ball drops, raise your elbow and hand, then make contact with the ball using an open hand. Follow through with your swing, stepping forward with your dominant foot as you complete the motion.</p>
